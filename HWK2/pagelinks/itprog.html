    <h1>The Information Technology Program</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Information Technology or IT for short is a wide-reaching field focused
      on the usage, management, and creation of computers and other electronic
      systems. Students within the IT program here at ASU learn the ins and outs
      of such systems, including the hardware that they are based on, the software
      used to facilitate data management, and more. The IT program at Polytechnic
      also allows students to focus on various aspects of the industry, such as
      networking, cloud computing, and computer security.
